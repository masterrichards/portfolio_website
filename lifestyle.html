      <p><b>MY BROTHER THE COMPUTER WIZ</b> 5/14<br></p>
      <p> My brother Kai has been teaching me about writing code and what is to be self sufficient in the world of the web far beyond what I've learned in school. Slowly but surely he has helped me develop this very website so I may proudly call it my own. The fact that I've tried doing as much as possible alone will explain any fu*k ups you may notice while you're navigating around. Thanks for your patience. I'm eager to keep learning and I appreciate the guidance. If you're reading this, take a moment to shoot your sibling/s, extended family, bff's or whoever has helped you "advance the ball", a quick thank you txt, email or scroll by falcon to let them know they've made a difference. Thanks Kai, for sharing in your technological gnarlyness and being a brother.

      <p><b>INSPIRATIONAL SHOUTOUTS! </b>3/14<br></p>

<p><b>Shepard Fairey</b><br>
The incorporation of a message political or otherwise within my artwork isn’t always necessary to me every time I start a new piece or project, but I realize art has the potential to cause explosive reactions from the public. Art can pull emotions out of people that may not have otherwise experienced them. When used in commercial applications I believe good design can keep its integrity intact and still remain authentic. From the distance of an admirer and note taker, Shepard Fairey is an inspiration of mine. In his earlier time as an artist, with simple well done designs, Shepard created chaotic curiosity amongst anyone who witnessed his wheat pasted works. Like a ripple effect in water, his art has gone viral on multiple occasions and has been seen all over the world. Fairey has launched himself to celebrity status. Using guerrilla advertising tactics he would post his icons in as many places as he deemed fit. His brand OBEY has spanned across multiple mediums. His clothing company sporting his graphics and messages have become extremely popular. Shepard Fairey is a great example of not just an artist but also an entrepreneur. He has worked very hard to elevate his art, and his style so much so that it has given him the ability to place momentum behind his endeavors and causes with overwhelming success.</p>
<!--second inspiration-->
<p><b>Jeremy Fish</b> <br>
  Growing up in the city of Minneapolis I have been exposed to many different cultures both above ground and some below. I've been attracted to hip hop music as long as I can remember . It was rapper / artist Aesop Rock that served this artist up to me on a silver platter of deep thought. The artworks of Jeremy Fish seem to go perfectly hand in hand with Aesop’s music. Jeremy Fish illustrates animal forms in abstract ways and draws inspiration from rich history of his environments, stories from his past and the people around him as well as current events. His style mirrors that of skateboard graphics and other familiar underground worlds. His story seems to be so linear to my own that I feel like I can relate to his art and creative processes. He’s older, more developed and has successfully overcome many obstacles that await myself I am sure. Fish’s subject matter and work literally make me want to make art. He sets a great example of someone who has done exactly what they wanted, made a name for themselves and used that momentum to fund a lifestyle they want to live. When I look at his art it always makes me think “holy shit thats cool”.
